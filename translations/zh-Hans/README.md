如果你正在阅读本手册的非英语版本，你或许会发现一些英文的部分还没有被翻译。 如果你想帮助翻译的话你需要通过 Crowdin 来完成。 请先阅读[贡献指导](/CONTRIBUTING.md)来了解这方面更多的信息。 You will find a number of english words that are programming concepts. If these were translated to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency when reading about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation followed by the english term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
