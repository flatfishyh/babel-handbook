If you are reading a non-english translation of this handbook you may still find english sections that have not yet been translated. (만약 영문 문서가 아닌 번역된 핸드북을 읽고 있다면, 여전히 번역되지 않은 영문 문서 섹션을 찾아 읽을 수 있습니다.) If you would like to contribute to one of the translations you must do so through Crowdin. (만약 다른 언어로 문서를 번역하고 싶다면 Crowdin을 통해 기여해야 합니다.) 자세한 사항은 [기여 가이드](/CONTRIBUTING.md)를 참고하세요. You will find a number of english words that are programming concepts. If these were translated to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency when reading about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation followed by the english term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
